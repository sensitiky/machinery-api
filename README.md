# Machinery API

## Description

Machinery API is a server-side application built using the NestJS framework. It provides a robust and scalable solution for managing machinery data and operations.

## Stack

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture, leveraging the power of NestJS to create a highly maintainable and scalable codebase. Key components include:

- **Modules**: Encapsulate related components such as controllers, services, and providers.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and return responses to the client.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with the database.
- **Entities**: Represent the data models used by the application.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: Define the shape of data sent over the network.
